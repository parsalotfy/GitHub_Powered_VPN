This repository fetchs list of L2TP vpn's once per day from FreeVPN4You site automatically (using github actions)
and then saves that list in a json file in the repository.

Password : vpn

Can someone create a mobile or pc client for this repository ?
It supposed to fetch the json file in this repository that includes necessary data to connect to vpn , and create a vpn client and then connect to it.
